This is my personal portfolio website created using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills, projects, education, and achievements as a B.Tech AIML student at KIET Group of Institutions. The portfolio features a modern and responsive design with smooth animations, a dedicated About Me section, project highlights, skills overview, and a contact section for easy communication. The code is clean, well-structured, and organized into separate HTML, CSS, and assets folders, making it simple to update and expand. This website represents my journey in technology and serves as a platform where I can present my work, connect with others, and continue improving as a developer.
